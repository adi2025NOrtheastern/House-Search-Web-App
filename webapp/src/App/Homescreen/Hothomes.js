                 A Hot Home is a home for sale that is expected to be among the most competitive homes on the market, according to the HomesByASAP Hot Homes algorithm.

                 The Hot Homes algorithm automatically calculates the likelihood by analyzing more than 500 attributes of each home - including price, property type, and neighborhood - as well as buyer preferences in the area.</p>
